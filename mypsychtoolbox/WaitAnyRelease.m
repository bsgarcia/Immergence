function [rt, k, t0, t] = WaitAnyRelease(keys, timeout)
% WaitAnyRelease - Wait for the next button or key to be released
%   Keyboard keys are mapped on 8:256. 
%   LENA-Buttons are read using ReadParPort and mapped on codes:
%       257 (for 1, left)
%       258 (for 2, middle)
%       259 (for 4, right)
%   By default, mouse clicks (which are mapped on 1=Left, 2=Right, 3=??,
%   4=Middle, 5=Backward, 6=Forward) are not listened to.
%
%    [rt, k, t0, t] = WaitAnyRelease(keys, timeout)
%
%OUPUTS:
%   rt: reaction time (NaN if no key was released before timeout)
%   k : array with 1 for the button/key which have been released
%   t0: onset time
%   t : real time of the release, so that rt = t - t0
